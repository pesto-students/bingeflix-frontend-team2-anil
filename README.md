# Technology Stack

We attempted to employ an entirely contemporary tech stack while experimenting with some novel, unexplored technologies. As a result, a quick, effective, and easily extensible web application was created, which should make it very future-proof for the next few years. Here's what We used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
